Your data will be stored and processed in whole or in part in the United States. If you access the Jobscan website outside the United States, your usage of our site constitutes consent to the transfer of your data out of your country and into the United States.

COLLECTION AND RETENTION OF INFORMATION
In some areas of our websites, Jobscan requests or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, gender, address, email address, telephone number, contact information, birthdate, billing information and any other information from which your identity is discernible. Jobscan may also request that you upload a copy of your resume and connect Jobscan to your LinkedIn profile, thereby providing personal information regarding your education, prior employment, occupation, titles, and skills, as well as your most recent profile picture, the last article you may have shares, number of connections, industry information and non-specific geolocation information.
We also gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is collected by Jobscan. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. We gather this information automatically and store it in log files. We do not link this automatically collected date to other information we collect about you.
Jobscan also collects, or logs, certain other information that cannot identify you personally when you visit our Sites. This information includes your Internet Protocol ("IP") address and your domain name. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by the ISP computer through which you access the web and a domain name is the name of the ISP computer itself through which you access the web. Jobscan logs these IP addresses and domain names and aggregates them for system administration and to monitor the use of our site. We may use the aggregated information to measure the number of visits to our site, the average time spent on our site, the number of pages viewed, and various other site use statistics. Such monitoring helps us evaluate how our Sites are used and continuously improve the content we provide.
In addition, Jobscan may collect indirect information about you when you use certain third party services on our site. For example, if you register on our site by using your LinkedIn user name and password, you authorize us to have access to and store the information from your LinkedIn Account profile; such information will be subject to, and treated in accordance with, the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy.
Jobscan receives information about you from certain of its third party partners, such as Google, Facebook and LinkedIn. You may be entitled to receive a list of the specific nonaffiliated third-parties that Jobscan receives your personal data from. If you would like to view such a list, please email our support at support@jobscan.co.
You can correct or update your Jobscan account profile, resume(s) or email alerts at any time. Moreover, you can delete your resume(s) from Jobscan 's online database or close your account(s) at any time, in which event we will remove all our copies of your resume and cover letters.
We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
We do not share, sell, rent or trade personal information with parties for their promotional purposes.
Unless required by law, we do not/will not collect or process any of the following types of sensitive data: Race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union memberships, genetic or biometric data, health or mortality, or sex life or sexual orientation.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES
We will not share your information with any third party outside of our organization except as provided in this Privacy Policy, other than product feedback. We will only allow your resume to be searchable to recruiters once Jobscan partners with recruiters and you opted in. Jobscan.co currently does not partner with any recruiters.
We do not disclose to third parties your personal information for promotional purposes, combined personal and demographic information or information about your use of an Jobscan website (such as the areas you visit or the services you access), except as set forth below.
We may disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the products or services of third parties at the time you register for an Jobscan account, we may supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, agents, brokers, dealers, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you email or otherwise communicating with you.

We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals may be located in a country whose data protection legislation is different from your country, and they will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose. We will remain the data controller and be responsible for any information shared in this way.
We may disclose such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Jobscan or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
We may disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of Jobscan's business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Jobscan becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Jobscan or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. If such event occurs we will display a prominent notice on our website.
Jobscan may also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to our websites with our clients, partners and other third parties so that they may understand the kinds of visitors to Jobscan's site and how those visitors use the site.

SECURITY
Jobscan has implemented technical and organizational measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Notwithstanding such measures, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. We will notify the owners of Jobscan accounts within 48 hours of the discovery of a data breach, and we will work with our customers to inform account holders who may have been directly affected by the breach.
Moreover, one of our primary purposes is to provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your profile/resume and profile widely and to maximize your career opportunities. Accordingly, such an environment does present a risk that unauthorized third parties will view this data. Further, your profile/resume should not contain any sensitive data including personality profiles or data that you would not want made public.
When you place an order online at Jobscan, your credit card information is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") protocol. SSL makes it difficult for your credit card information to be intercepted or stolen while being transmitted. Jobscan uses a service company to process its credit card transactions.
We also use cookies, web beacons, and Java Script to administer our site and deliver a personalized experience. For additional detailed information on each of these, please see below.
You are responsible for ensuring that your log-in credentials (your username and password) are kept confidential.
USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, scripts and tags are used by Jobscan and our partners, affiliates or analytics or service providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the website, tracking users' movements around the site, and gathering demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing these types of tracking technologies.
We use cookies on our site to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Jobscan pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). We also use cookies of certain third party partners, including Indeed.com, Hotjar and Mixpanel, which have plugins installed on our site.
Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the Jobscan site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing.
You may have the ability to accept or decline Jobscan and/or third party cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the Jobscan website. To protect your privacy, be sure to close your browser completely after you have finished conducting business with a website that does use cookies.
HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Customers using certain modern browsers have the ability to activate a “Do Not Track” signal. Jobscan does not currently respond to the “Do Not Track” signal.
THIRD PARTIES
Our site contains links to other websites over which we have no control. Jobscan is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from the Jobscan website. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other websites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information we collect on the Jobscan website, and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.
YOUR CALIFORNIA RIGHTS
A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California customer”) is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed.
However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.
We do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.
California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing us at support@jobscan.co. Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
CHILDREN
Jobscan is not intended for children under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 16.
CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on this page so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and to whom we will disclose it.
